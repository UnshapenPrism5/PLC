# Moving Conveyor

In some systems a conveyor belt is moved from one side to the other to transfer
one conveyor line to another. This can be used to ensure that the items on the 
belt moves in circles until someone removes it from the belt.

In this system I will code a project that will load one item onto the conveyor
belt and then move the conveyor to the other line, where this item will be unloaded
before the conveyor moves back to the original position.
