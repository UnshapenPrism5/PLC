# Stop/Start Latch

This program is commonly used to switch on a system using a NO-button
and stop the system once the NC-button is pressed

In this program I will code a latch that will switch on a system and keep
it live until the stop button is pressed, which will switch off the system
and reset all inputs and outputs to the original state.
