# Splitter system

A splitter is used in a system to split one object from another. For example if 
we want to split green apples from red apples.

In this project I will split one line into two lines based on the bar code that
is read from a box. This system can be used by couriers to split the boxes that
is going to Pretoria from the boxes that is going to Johannesburg.
