# Lift

In a lift system one item at a time is loaded onto a lift. This lift is then 
circulated upwards until it reaches the point where is unloads a item.

In this project I will code a lift that will check for an item to be loaded 
onto the lift. Once the item is loaded and the other end is unloaded, the system
will start a motor to move the lift upwards. Once the lift reaches it's exit
the lift will unload the item and load a new item onto the other end of the lift.
